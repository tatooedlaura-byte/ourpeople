# Our People

A family directory that explains relationships in plain language - like family reunion nametags.

## What Makes It Different

Instead of computing complex genealogy labels like "second cousin once removed", Our People explains relationships through **names you know**:

- "Grandma Mary's sister" instead of "great-aunt"
- "Uncle Mike's daughter" instead of "first cousin"
- Common shortcuts kept: grandma, aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew

## Features

- **Perspective Switching**: Pick who you are, and all relationships update to your point of view
- **Shareable Data**: Export the family data, share it with relatives - each person picks their own perspective
- **Photo Support**: Add photos to recognize people at reunions
- **Nametag-Style Display**: See connections like "Father of Karen, Amy, Joe"
- **Offline-First**: Works without internet, data stays on your device

## How It Works

1. Add people to your family directory
2. Select yourself from "Viewing as" dropdown
3. Add simple relationships (parent, child, sibling, spouse, friend)
4. Tap anyone to see who they are - explained through people you know
